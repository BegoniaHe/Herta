  // the retry stream, then types the retry forward from there (reduced
  // motion mirrors the retry directly). Animation policy is a renderer

  // strings. Caveat: the server-computed `keepLen` indexes the raw stream;
  // for normal text the scrub is the identity so indices agree — only a
  // hostile stream can shift the erase floor by a few chars (cosmetic).

                  Composing caret: the verdict-gated pacing HOLDS the stream

                  the app being stuck (user report 2026-07-04). The caret
                  pulses for the whole stream so any hold reads as "still
                  composing". During a retract it hides ONLY for the erase
                  (the deletion motion owns the visual); once retry deltas
                  buffer (the fill phase — which has its own TTFT/starvation
