 * puts the action first and the evidence inside it, which is also what makes
 * the diff collapsible instead of unconditionally printed.
 *
 * The pairing is by ADJACENCY, not by verb. `permissions.check` publishes the
 * preview and `tool.call.started` projects the op immediately after, so the
 * next step IS the operation — whatever it is called. That matters: under the
 * minimal contract (the default) a heredoc write comes from `bash`, and its
 * row reads `Running`, not `Writing`.
 *
 * Adjacency is also the safety property. A DENIED write publishes its preview
 * and then never starts, so what follows is a tool-fail row; without the
 * adjacency requirement the orphaned diff would attach itself to some later,
 * unrelated operation. A preview that finds no operation immediately after it
 * stands as its own row instead — the record never loses a block to a
 * presentation rule (D7).
