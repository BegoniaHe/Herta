/**
 * Render `text` with every bare `@板砖` wrapped in a chip span. `variant`
 * "bubble" uses the full padded pill; "composer" uses the metric-safe class
 * (no padding, inherited weight) so the textarea caret never drifts. Plain
 * text nodes render as bare fragments, so a mention-free string stays a single
 * text node (existing getByText queries keep working).
 *
 * `lang` localizes the USER-FACING presentation of 板砖 to the conversation's
 * language: an EN conversation displays the trigger chip as `@Brick` and bare
 * 板砖 references as `Brick`. This is DISPLAY-ONLY — the record/wire token stays
 * 板砖 (Herta emits it, the harness dispatches on it). The alias applies only to
 * the committed `bubble` variant: the `composer` overlay must stay
 * metric-identical to the textarea (a CJK→Latin swap would drift the caret), so
 * it never substitutes.
 *
 * The EN composer additionally CHIPS a typed `@brick` (any case) — the input
 * form an EN user actually types — but renders the node's literal matched
 * text, never a substitution (caret metrics again). Bubbles don't need this:
 * a committed record never contains `@brick` (translated to the wire token on
 * send).
