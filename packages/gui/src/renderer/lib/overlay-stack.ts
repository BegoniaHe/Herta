/**
 * A tiny global registry of the currently-open modal overlays (settings, the
 * approval panel, the key prompt, card menus). The TOPMOST overlay owns
 * global keyboard semantics — Escape, autofocus.
 *
 * Why: these surfaces each attached their own document/window keydown
 * listeners with no coordination, so with Settings open over a pending
 * permission gate, one Escape press closed Settings AND silently DENIED the
 * approval behind the frosted backdrop; the approval panel also stole
 * keyboard focus from inside the Settings card, letting a stray Enter
 * approve an invisible request (GUI review 2026-07-04, H1/H2).
 *
 * "Topmost" is decided by an explicit z-level MIRRORING the CSS stacking
 * (see the constants below), NOT registration order: the approval panel is
 * an inline layer (z 40) that a later-arriving Settings backdrop (z 60)
 * visually covers — and equally, a gate arriving while Settings is already
 * open must slot in BELOW it. Ties break to the most recently opened.
 *
 * Deliberately not React context: the stack is genuinely global (overlays
 * mount in different subtrees), and handlers need a synchronous read.
