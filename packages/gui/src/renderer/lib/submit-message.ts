 * the Composer and the KeyPrompt's re-send so the no-key handling lives in one
 * place.
 *
 * `submitText` resolves at TURN END for a real turn (so the `.then` lands late
 * and is a no-op by then — the real user block long since replaced the echo),
 * but resolves IMMEDIATELY in the no-key case (the session pre-checks the key
 * before running anything).
