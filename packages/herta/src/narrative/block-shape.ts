 * without a second supervisor pass"), the same-state empty-speech
 * retry, a supervisor deadline/provider error fail-softing to OK, and
 * an install with `config.supervisor.enabled = false` — commits
 * whatever the model produced. A degenerate completion that emits the
 * TEMPLATE SLOT instead of filling it (`{需要说的话}`) therefore reaches
 * the user verbatim. That was a real report, 2026-08-12.
 *
 * This needs no model to recognise, so it runs at the commit boundary
 * and covers all four paths at zero latency and zero tokens.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NARROW. It fires only when the WHOLE line is a slot
 * token, because the cost of a false positive is suppressing real
 * speech. Specifically it must NOT catch:
 *   - "把 `{}` 改成 `[]`" — she talks about code; braces INSIDE a
 *     sentence are ordinary content.
 *   - "……" — the 被烦版 silence reply is BY DESIGN (mood lab
 *     2026-07-17); a punctuation-only line is not this bug.
 *   - "（他没听懂。）" — a parenthetical-only line is narration, which
 *     is the supervisor's rule, not a template slot. Different defect,
 *     different owner.

/**
 * Remove echoed HINT SCAFFOLDING from a generation (live lab, 2026-08-12).
 *
 * Every actor hint is wrapped in `〔…〕` and appended to the prompt directly
 * before the open tag, so the model's last few hundred tokens of context are
 * a bracketed instruction. It sometimes continues in that format — writing
 * its own `〔…〕` aside before (or instead of) the real block. Measured at
 * 2 of 96 real generations, both on the longest, most instructional retry
 * variants; never on short first-pass hints.
 *
 * Two observed shapes, and they want opposite repairs:
 *
 *   `〔instruction〕\n真正的台词`  — the model restated the hint, then
 *       answered. The answer is what follows; drop the bracket line.
 *   `〔完整的一段思考〕`          — the content is GOOD, only the wrapper is
 *       wrong. Unwrap it rather than discard a usable block.
 *
 * Safe because `〔…〕` is reserved: it appears in hint files and nowhere in
 * her corpus (Bio, Guide, EnvSet, openings, 废案 seeds all verified clean),
 * so a leading, trailing or whole-wrap bracket is never her voice. A bracket
 * appearing mid-sentence is left alone — only a pair at an EDGE is
 * scaffolding.
 *
 * A third shape, trailing (large-document lab, 2026-08-23, twice in one
 * session after a 13-minute backend turn had filled the record):
 *
 *   `真正的台词 〔到这里，只准停，…不得写任何命令。〕` — the answer, then a
 *       bracketed directive the model wrote for its own NEXT step, in the
 *       hint's register. Both reached the user's screen verbatim. Drop the
 *       trailing pair; the answer is what precedes it.
 *
 *   The trailing case is narrower than the leading one ON PURPOSE. The
 *   first cut stripped any trailing pair, and the same day a speech that
 *   ended in a list of quoted lines committed as `…没拿行号顶页码：` — the
 *   list was gone. `〔…〕` is reserved in the HARNESS's prose, but Chinese
 *   typography uses it for citation marks (`〔1〕`, `〔行 7902〕`), which is
 *   exactly what a speech citing a document ends with. So a trailing pair
 *   is stripped only when its content reads as a directive (只准/不得/
 *   不写/无命令/… — the register of both observed leaks); a citation-shaped
 *   pair stays. A leading pair keeps the original rule: content never
 *   starts with a bare citation.
 *
 * Runs BEFORE the usability check, which is what makes the nested case work:
 * `〔{需要说的话}〕` unwraps to `{需要说的话}`, which `isPlaceholderOnly`
 * then catches, so it takes the slot ladder instead of committing. Stripping
 * never rescues junk — it just stops the wrapper from hiding it.
 */
