/**
 * CN/EN prose for the harness's **elision markers** — the lines a
 * projection writes to tell Herta that something which used to be in
 * front of her no longer is.
 *
 * Why these localize when record chrome does not: `→ 系统`,
 * `（我 说）`, `Reading {…}` and friends are the record's canonical
 * grammar, identical in every session (D2/D7, ADR 0017/0018 — display
 * localizes, the record does not). These strings are neither — they are
 * the harness talking TO Herta about her own prompt, the same register
 * as `session-recap-runtime`'s `〔更早的 N 段记录因篇幅略去〕`, which
 * has been per-lang since the EN interaction slices. An EN session
 * should not be told its history was compacted in Chinese.
 *
 * `板砖` stays literal in both: it is the wire token, and the EN prompt
 * corpus already treats it as a proper noun in English prose ("I call it
 * 板砖 — 'the brick'", prompts-en/EnvSet.txt). The `@Brick` alias of
 * ADR 0015 is a *display* alias and deliberately does not reach here.
 *
 * Wording discipline — these markers are read by a model that must not
 * claim to have seen what it cannot see, so each one states the fact
 * plainly (`历史已压缩`, not the old label-shaped `压缩历史`) and the
 * whole family shares one verb for removal (略去 / elided).
