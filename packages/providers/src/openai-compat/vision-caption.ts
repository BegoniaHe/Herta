 * One-shot image captioning over the chat endpoint (ADR 0048 §3).

 * Deliberately NOT part of `ProviderAdapter`. The adapter's `PromptFrame`
 * carries string-content messages, and images ride OpenAI-style content parts
 * — widening the whole transcript union for one sidecar would touch every
 * translate/stream path for a caller that streams nothing, holds no history
 * and asks one question. This is a narrow function over the same retrying
 * POST: body in, one line of text out.
 *
 * Non-streaming on purpose: nothing consumes a caption incrementally, and a
 * single JSON response has no SSE watchdog to reason about.
