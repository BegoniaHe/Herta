/**
 * A ref may contain `-` but may not START with one.
 *
 * `-` is a literal inside this character class, so the previous pattern
 * accepted `--ext-diff` and `-c` as refs — and git parses them as OPTIONS
 * (verified 2026-08-25: `git diff --stat --no-color --ext-diff` exits 0, where
 * a bogus ref exits 128). Since git honours the LAST occurrence of a repeated
 * option, a model-supplied ref could re-enable the external diff driver that
 * this tool passes `--no-ext-diff` to disable — in a `readOnly` tool that
 * raises no approval card. The argv also ends with `--`; this is the guard
 * that makes that redundant rather than the other way round.
