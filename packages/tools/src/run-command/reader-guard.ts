/**
 * The fs-based half of the reader-argv guard (audit T3.4). The synchronous
 * classifier can only inspect argv TEXT, so a workspace file with an innocent
 * basename that is actually a SYMLINK to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (or anywhere outside
 * the repo) passed `readerArgvGuard` and was auto-allowed — the OS followed
 * the link and the credential's contents entered the tool result, the
 * evidence store, `.herta/logs`, and the prompt tail. read_file /
 * search_text / list_files already realpath every target through
 * resolveSafePath; run_command's readers were the one gap.
 *
 * This mirrors that: for each file-path operand of an allow-listed reader,
 * canonicalize it against the EFFECTIVE cwd and, if it resolves to an
 * existing file whose real target leaves the workspace or names credential
 * material, DENY (matching read_file's hard-deny; ask would be worse — the
 * displayed command `cat notes.txt` HIDES that it really reads id_rsa, so the
 * user can't knowingly approve it).
 *
 * Only EXISTING operands are checked: a grep/find PATTERN or a not-yet-created
 * name doesn't resolve to a file (realpath throws) and is skipped, so no false
 * denials — and a reader can't exfiltrate a file that doesn't exist. The
 * textual absolute/parent/credential-name cases stay in the classifier's
 * `readerArgvGuard` (ask), where the user sees the real target.
 *
 * Returns the first denial, or null when every operand is safe / not a reader.
 * Runs in the permission rule (where deny gates execution) AND at tool
 * execution time (defense-in-depth against a symlink swapped in the window
 * between the permission check and the spawn).
 *
 * Read carve-outs (large-document lab, 2026-08-23): this guard only ever
 * judges the operands of a READ-ONLY command, so it carries the same three
 * read carve-outs `str_replace_editor view` has — attachments (ADR 0033),
 * harness evidence (ADR 0025 slice 2) and the redacted logs (ADR 0036). It
 * did not, and under the minimal contract (the default since 2026-08-17)
 * that was the ONLY reader without them: `sed -n '1,400p'
 * .herta/attachments/<sid>/report.pdf.txt` was hard-denied with "denied
 * segment: .herta", while `str_replace_editor view` of the same path passed.
 * A one-screen document survived on `view` alone; anything longer hit the
 * 16K clip whose note says "grep -n inside the file" — and grep was denied.
 * 板砖 worked around it by `cp`-ing the document into the workspace root
 * (an ask, and a copy of the user's document in their repo — the storage
 * shape ADR 0033 rejected) or by hiding the path in a shell variable (an
 * unrecognised command, so one approval card per chunk). The structural
 * `.herta` denial is the only check the carve-outs skip: the credential
 * basename/directory denylist still runs on the realpath'd target, and
 * every shell output is redacted before it reaches the model or the record.
