/**
 * Put a VERBATIM slice of a workspace file in front of both the user and
 * Herta (2026-07-27).
 *
 * Why this exists: a successful `read_file` projects nothing but its path
 * (backend-bridge only surfaces result blocks for the run_command trio), so
 * the content lives solely in the backend's own transcript. Herta never sees
 * it and neither does the user — "show me what's in that log" was
 * unanswerable, only reachable by shelling out to `sed`/`grep` and reading
 * the 15-line command tail.
 *
 * Why the HARNESS slices instead of the model passing text: the request this
 * serves is usually some form of "原样 / verbatim", and a model retyping
 * content into a tool argument can paraphrase, trim, or translate it. Taking
 * a path plus a range (or a match) makes fidelity a property of the harness
 * rather than a promise from the model — the same reflex as D4, applied to
 * accuracy.
 *
 * `readOnly` and the ordinary path guard: this is a read, and it is exempt
 * from almost nothing. It does NOT set `allowHarnessReadPaths` — read_file has
 * that carve-out so the backend can follow the harness's own
 * `.herta/tool-results/…` pointers, but PRESENTING unredacted harness
 * internals to the user is not what this tool is for.
 *
 * It DOES set `allowAttachmentPaths` (ADR 0033) and
 * `allowEvidenceExcerptPaths` (ADR 0036, amending ADR 0027 §5's blanket
 * exclusion). The distinctions are the reason those are separate flags:
 * `.herta/attachments/` holds documents the 开拓者 handed over — user
 * content stored under a harness directory — and showing one back is
 * exactly this tool's job; `.herta/logs/` holds shell output that passed
 * `redactSecrets` at capture, and the persona E2E (2026-08-11) showed the
 * one honest answer to "念给我听那行输出" is a bounded excerpt of that
 * receipt — the backend tried three times and was denied, leaving
 * paraphrase as the only path. `tool-results/` stays excluded: it is
 * written verbatim, so quoting it would surface unredacted bytes.
