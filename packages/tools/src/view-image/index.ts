/**
 * Look at a picture (ADR 0048 slice 3).
 *
 * The caption on an attachment row is one shot and lossy by design: it says
 * what the picture IS, not everything it contains. When a question outruns it
 * — "what does the error in the corner say", "which row is highlighted" — the
 * answer is not a longer caption but a RE-LOOK, by someone with eyes. That is
 * the actor-agent split doing its job: Herta reads the record, 板砖 reads the
 * file, and the answer comes back as a finding she can speak from.
 *
 * Mounted ONLY on a vision-capable backend model. Without one the tool is
 * absent rather than failing at call time: a model that cannot see should not
 * be told it can, and the honest answer to a visual question then remains the
 * caption's own boundary.
 *
 * `readOnly` and path-guarded like `show_excerpt`, with the attachment
 * carve-out (ADR 0033) — the pictures worth re-reading are precisely the ones
 * the 开拓者 handed over, which live under `.herta/attachments/`.
